# gita-for-busy
I created a Chrome extension that allows users to read the Bhagavad Gita in a user-friendly way. The extension features a simple interface to select the chapter and verse of the Gita that the user wants to read. It could be an excellent resource for anyone interested in exploring the Bhagavad Gita. Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
